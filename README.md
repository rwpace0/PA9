Our game is a simple platformer where you play a tennis ball trying to avoid getting caught by beagles!
The controls are very simple:
W, Up Arrow, Spacebar - Jump (W and Up Arrow also traverse menus upward)
A, Left Arrow - Walk Left
D, Right Arrow - Walk Right
S, Down Arrow - Menu Down
Escape - Open Pause Menu

The player has 100 health and will lose 20 upon colliding with a beagle. Lose all 100 health or fall off the platforms to lose the game.
To avoid the beagles simply use your movement controls to dodge or jump onto different platforms. Some may move, so be careful!
You will notice a clock counting up at the top of your screen, that is how long you have been alive for.
The longer that clock runs, they harder the game becomes.
As each minute goes by, beagles will spawn faster and faster. Once a minute passes, the spawn rate drops back to normal but the beagle will have a friend!
This process will repeat until either you can no longer avoid the beagles or you fall off the map.
Try to survive the ever increasing onslaught of beagles for as long as possible!
And don't worry, if you do lose you can always hit Enter to try again!

Now that you know the game, all you have to do is open the solution to hit build and run!
